\begin{abstract}
Embedding text in one language within text of another is commonplace
for numerous purpoces,
but in general can be done reliably and securely only
with the help of tedious and error-prone
``escaping'' transformations on the embedded string.
We propose a simple cross-language syntactic discipline,
\emph{matchertext},
which enables the safe embedding a string in any compliant language
into a string in any other language via simple ``copy-and-paste'' --
in particular with no escaping or other obfuscation of embedded strings.
We apply this syntactic to a number of common (and frequently-embedded)
language syntaxes such as URIs, HTML, and JavaScript,
exploring the benefits, costs, and compatibility issues
in adopting the matchertext discipline.
