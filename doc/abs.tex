\begin{abstract}
Embedding text in one language within text of another is commonplace
for numerous purposes,
but usually requires tedious and error-prone
``escaping'' transformations on the embedded string.
We propose a simple cross-language syntactic discipline,
\emph{matchertext},
which enables the safe embedding a string in any compliant language
into a string in any other language via simple ``copy-and-paste'' --
in particular with no escaping, obfuscation, or expansion of embedded strings.
We apply this syntactic discipline
to several common and frequently-embedded
language syntaxes such as URIs, HTML, and JavaScript,
exploring the benefits, costs, and compatibility issues
in adopting the proposed matchertext discipline.
One early matchertext-based language is MinML,
a concise but general alternative syntax for writing HTML or XML.
