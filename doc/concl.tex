\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:concl}

Matchertext is a syntactic discipline
that enables the verbatim embedding of strings across languages
with no transformation or expansion,
by enforcing only the single rule that the ASCII matchers --
parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces --
must always appear strictly in matched pairs.
We develop the basic principles and rationale for matchertext,
and explore potential backward-compatible extensions
to existing classes of languages
both to host embedded matchertext strings,
and to write embeddable matchertext conveniently.
Further experience is needed implementing and using matchertext
in order to evaluate its benefits and costs empirically.
