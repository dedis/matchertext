\subsection{C-like strings and character escapes}

A wide variety of languages have adopted C-like string literal syntax,
in which either single or double quotes surround a string literal,
and backslashes within the literal introduce escape sequences
used to include sensitive or special characters literally in the string
(\eg \verb|\'|, \verb|\"|, \verb|\\|, \verb|\n|, \verb|\t|, etc.).
There are two main ways in which we might wish to enhance such languages
to support matchertext,
depending on whether the language in question is the host language
or the embedded language.

\subsubsection{Hosting matchertext within C-like strings}
