\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:eval}

Some key questions to evaluate:
\begin{itemize}
\item	For a set of popular (big or little) languages,
	how common are natural violations of matchertext discipline?
	Of what kinds are most common (e.g., in string constants, comments)?
	How painful is it to fix these violations?
\item	How common and painful are needs to escape embedded strings
	when manually embedding into surrounding language strings?
	For example, how commonly do actual URIs embedded into
	actual program code need or use manual escaping?
\item	How common have security bugs been related to
	inadequate escape armoring when embedding automatically?
\item	How common and what kinds of needs are there for
	multiple levels of embedding?
\end{itemize}
